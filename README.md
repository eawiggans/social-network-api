# Social Network API


## Description
This is the backend of a social network app. It allows you to have users and associated thoughts, plus reactions to those thoughts. A well-organized backend will allow users to get the most out of a social network app and will keep them using the app for longer.

## Usage
Open the repository locally, and run the server.js file. Then app can be tested in Insomnia: adding and deleting users, thoughts, and reactions.

A walkthrough video of the app in use can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1cfHqJLC-zfupLtF6t4sEbLZmblN6XH/view).
